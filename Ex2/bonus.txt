Under [output_dir]/errors/general_errors.errors the simulation reports errors (if there are any) regarding command arguments, algorithm registration, and input files, (found before the algorithms are run).

For each pair of algorithm and travel we create a file under out/errors (.alg_errors suffix) where we report the errors (if there are any) reported by the algorithm during this travel (translated from the error code returned by calls to the algorithm).


For each pair of algorithm and travel we create a file under out/errors (.crane_errors suffix) where we report errors (if there are any) regarding bad behaviour of the algorithm, caught by the simulation. Note that unless the algorithm failed to initialize properly, we run the simulation for the entire travel and keep accumulating such errors. In case the error was caused by a specific instruction we also report the relevant erroneous instruction.

Under algorithm/badAlgorithm running make would build a badAlgorithm.so file, which provides various (random) erroneous operations.
In the example_travels a number of example travel folders can be found (some are erroneous).

Running the simulation with badAlgorithm.so on the travels in exmaple_travels and viewing the various error files generated under [output_dir]/errors can provide a demonstration for the way the simulation reports errors.
